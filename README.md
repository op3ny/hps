## Overview

HPS is a **federated peer-to-peer platform** that allows users to:

- Publish content
- Own identities
- Use `hps://` domains
- Create and verify contracts
- Transfer value (vouchers)

All without a central authority.

---

## Goals

- User control over data  
- No hidden censorship  
- Transparent actions  
- Verifiable system  

---

## Architecture

### Server (Go)
Handles storage, contracts and sync.

### Browser (C#)
User interface and navigation.

### CLI (C#)
Advanced interaction and automation.

### Miner (Optional)
Generates vouchers (Proof-of-Work).

### Proxy (Optional)
Improves network communication.

---

## Network Model

- No central server  
- Multiple servers  
- Users can switch freely  
- Identity is portable  

---

## Security Model

- Public/private key identity  
- Signed actions  
- Automatic verification  

---

## Contract System

Everything important is a contract:

- Uploads  
- Transfers  
- Domains  

No contract = no trust.

---

## Distributed Content

Files are stored with:

- Hash  
- Signature  
- History  

---

## Decentralized DNS

```
hps://example.site
```

- Owned domains  
- Transferable  
- No registrar  

---

## Reputation System

- Affects usage  
- Dynamic and visible  

---

## HPS Economy (Vouchers)

Used for:

- Uploads  
- Contracts  
- Domains  
- Anti-spam  

---

## Browser Interface

- Navigation  
- Alerts  
- Verification  

---
